# Atliq_Mart_Supply_Chain_Analysis___Power-BI
**Problem statement**

AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodra. They want to expand to other metro/tier1 cities in the next 2 years.

AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend the annual contract due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ’On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers on a daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.

The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure ‘on-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’ and OnTime in full (OTIF) % of the customer orders on a daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.

**Some Major Insights**

* All the key KPIs (OT%, IF%, OTIF%) were built to overview the performance which was far below the estimated target.
* City-wise, product-wise and customer-wise metrics were created to analyze the performance and it was seen that the top customer by quantity was receiving less than 50% orders placed and the second top customer 
  was getting only 29% of the orders on time which was a serious concern and stakeholders need to address about production and delivery estimate of orders.
* 16,491 Products out of 57,096 products were delayed than the agreed delivery date and 14,982 Orders out of 31,729 were not delivered in full.
* Highest number of orders were received from Ahmedabad city (11,061) and lowest by Surat (9,696).
* Late deliveries and partial delivery of orders is a serious concern for any business and stakeholders need to address about supply, production and delivery estimate of orders in a more efficient manner.
